You express rules in a programming language. They act on data and your program provides answers
            ______________
Rules ---->| Traditional  |
           |  Programming |------> Answers
Data  ---->|______________|


Instead of trying to define the rules and express them in a programming language, you provide the answers (typically called labels) 
along with the data, and the machine infers the rules that determine the relationship between the answers and data.
            ______________
Answers--->|   Machine    |
           |  Learning    |------> Rules
Data  ---->|______________|


In traditional programming, your code compiles into a binary that is typically called a program. In ML, the item that you create from the data and labels is called a model.

Consider the result of that to be a model, which is used like this at runtime:
 
            ______________
           |              |
Data  ---->|     Model    |------> Predictions
           |______________|
           
You pass the model some data and the model uses the rules that it inferred from the training to make a prediction
