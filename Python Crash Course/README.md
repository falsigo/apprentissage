These are the python files which were written while undergoing a brushup beginner python course 
available for free on YouTube by FCC, wathcable currently on the link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw

The files howerer are not serialized in their occcurence in the learning phase but are named accordingly, 
some names might come off as vague but simply going through the program will help you understand since this
is pretty much the basic stuff.
